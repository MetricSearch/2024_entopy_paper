# 2024_entopy_paper
 matlab code for 2024 entropy paper

Notes:

get_logits folder has the code we used to generate the first 10k logits for each network from the MirFlickr 1M image collection

matlab data files containing the logits are also in that folder, there is no need to regenerate using this code.
